# iFridge - ID2216 Web Application Prototype

- This is the web application prototype from KTH ID2216.

- The contributors of this project are Jian Wen, Yu Xia, Tangyujun Han, and Xiangyu Liu.

- To view this application, download this repo and deploy it on a local web server.

- The application, named iFridge, is a refrigerator management tool for daily life. This application will record ingredients stored in the refrigerator and help users manage the amount and shelf-life of items. Based on the items stored, this application can also give suggestions of dishes that can be cooked and provide links to these dishes. 

- Since we are just getting started, so we only have a simple demo using React. Currently, we are receiving comments and ideas for our web prototype. Your feedback will help us update our design and complete our course.
